AUTHENTICA — AI Rights Manifest (v1)

The AUTHENTICA AI Rights Manifest defines the first sovereign, machine-readable standard for declaring the origin, rights, and AI-usage restrictions of creative works.

This specification provides creators, publishers, cultural institutions, and collective management organizations with a verifiable framework to:

• declare human-origin or AI-assisted origin
• restrict AI training, analysis, generation, and commercial reuse
• enforce EU TDM (Text and Data Mining) opt-out (Directive 2019/790)
• meet transparency and provenance obligations required by the EU AI Act
• attach cryptographic proof-of-origin to any creative work
• ensure interoperability with the UID_AUTH universal identifier

Standard Foundations

The AUTHENTICA AI Rights Manifest is aligned with:

• W3C ActivityStreams
• JSON-LD
• EU Directive 2019/790 (TDM Opt-Out)
• EU AI Act transparency & provenance requirements

Purpose

AUTHENTICA establishes a sovereign, verifiable layer of metadata enabling:

• protection of human creativity against unauthorized AI extraction
• clear, explicit rights for the use or non-use of works by AI systems
• long-term cultural preservation through machine-readable provenance
• compatibility with registration and certification infrastructures
