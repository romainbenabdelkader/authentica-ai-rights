AUTHENTICA — AI Rights Manifest (v1)

This repository hosts the official, machine-readable specification defining the rights, restrictions, and proof-of-origin metadata for creative works registered through AUTHENTICA.

The standard enables:
	•	declaration of human-origin
	•	AI training restrictions
	•	TDM (Text and Data Mining) opt-out
	•	cryptographic signatures
	•	interoperability with UID_AUTH (universal work identifier)

The manifest format is compliant with:
	•	W3C ActivityStreams
	•	JSON-LD
	•	EU Directive 2019/790 (TDM Opt-Out)
	•	EU AI Act transparency & provenance obligations

AUTHENTICA provides creators, publishers, and collective management organizations with a sovereign, verifiable standard to express:
	•	which uses by AI systems are allowed or forbidden,
	•	when and where the work was first proven,
	•	how the origin, timestamp, and integrity are certified,
	•	how the work can be detected, audited, or verified.

Each manifest is signed and bound to its unique UID_AUTH, forming a tamper-proof record of:
	•	identity
	•	origin
	•	rights
	•	fingerprint
	•	provenance

This repository contains:
	•	manifest-v1.jsonld — the core machine-readable specification
	•	schema definitions for future versions (v2, v3…)
	•	examples for audio, text, image, and video works

AUTHENTICA aims to provide a unified and sovereign infrastructure enabling creators to control the use of their works by AI systems while ensuring legal compliance across Europe and beyond.
