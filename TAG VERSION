AUTHENTICA Protocol – Initial Standard (v1.0.0)

Description

This release marks the first public version of the AUTHENTICA Proof-of-Origin Standard.
It includes:
• the LockDNA native fingerprint specification
• the AUTHENTICA Manifest (JSON-LD)

This version introduces the core principle of AUTHENTICA:
the fingerprint is extracted from the file, never embedded inside it.
